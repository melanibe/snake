# A basic implementation of snake
This repository contains a basic implementation of the famous snake game in order to discover the features of the Tkinter library. 

Features of the game:
* Standard snake rules: the goal is to catch the red squares representing the bonus. Every time you touch a bonus your snake grows. It is forbidden to go backwards, to touch another part of the snake with its head, to go out of the window. Any of these actions will trigger the "Game over" screen. 
* Level and score: each time you touch a bonus your score increases by 100 times your level. Every 5 bonus touches, your level increases and the speed of the snake increases too.
* Press the QUIT button to close the game window and interrupt the program.

To launch the game just run the `snake.py` file.
